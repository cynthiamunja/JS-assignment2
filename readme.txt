Requirements:
 
Functionality:
 
User selects their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) through buttons or user input.
Computer randomly chooses its move (0-0.33 rock, 0.34-0.66 paper, 0.67-1 scissors).
Winner is determined based on standard rock paper scissors rules.
Display the result (win, lose, tie) and user/computer choices on the screen.
Consider adding scorekeeping and a winner declaration for multiple rounds (optional).
Code Structure:
 
Use at least one function declaration.
Use at least one function expression.
Use at least one arrow function.
Use at least one anonymous function.
Use a ternary operator for a concise outcome display 
Utilize default parameters in a function
 
Cheat Mode:
 
Design a "cheat mode" feature that alters the computer's choice in some way (optional).
Come up with one specific implementation of cheat mode (e.g., computer always chooses scissors).
 
 
Question Two
 
Write a JavaScript function that takes a comma-separated numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers. The function should validate the input:
 
If any non-numeric characters are present (except commas), treat those values as zero.
If the input string is empty, return zero.
